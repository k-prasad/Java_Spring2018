Sample programs are attached. Remove the extension ".txt" from 
mc_test.sh.txt. (My SMTP server does not allow me to send out
a shell script.) That's a Bash script to run MCTest. It uses the Unix 
command "time" to measure program execution time. If you don't use Unix 
on your machine, replace "time" with an equivalent command. If you don't 
want to use the script, modify MCTest.java to measure program execution 
time and run it manually. For example, call System.currentTimeMillis() 
before and after doing multiplication
