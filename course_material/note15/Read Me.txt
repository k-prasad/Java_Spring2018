Attached is a sample program that generates prime numbers with an 
executor. It uses InterruptiblePrimeNumberGenerator, which I gave you in 
the beginning of this semester. It calls shutdown(), which allows 
previously-submitted tasks (gen1 and gen2) to complete generating primes 
before shutting down the executor. If you replace shutdown() with 
shutdownNow(), the executor interrupts 2 worker threads to stop gen1 and 
gen2. See how gen1 and gen2 behave upon thread interruption.

The sample program uses an executor with a fixed-size thread pool. Try 
to use other types of executors.

Also, compare this sample program with PrimeNumberGenTest.java, which I 
gave you, to see how the executor framework changes client code for 
prime number generators.
